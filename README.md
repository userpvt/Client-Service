<h1> CLIENT SERVICE </h1>
<p>This is a simple project designed to learn Spring Boot, RESTfull, Postman etc.</p>
<h3>Functions and description of the project: </h3>
<p>1.In this project, I showed the work of RESTful service methods: GET / POST / PUT / DELETE.</p>
<p>2.I used something similar to a client service. Using queries through Postman, you can manage your data.</p>
<p>3.Project structure: model, controller and service.</p>
<p>4.In the project I used only Getter and Setter, therefore I didn’t connect the “lomb” in the dependencies, since there was no need.</p>
<h3>The commands and requests for working with Postman that I used:</h3>
<p>1.Methods: POST/GET/PUT/DELETE</p>
<p>2.URI: <pre>
http: // localhost: 8080 / clients.</p>
</pre>
<p>3.If you need to change (PUT) any field or delete (DELETE) a specific client, then you need to add the desired ID.
For example: after
  <pre>
http: // localhost: 8080 / clients / 1.</p>
</pre>
<h3>IDE</h3>
Import the project into your IDE and run it as a Spring Boot Application. <br>
